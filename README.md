A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

The goal of the recommendation system is to predict which products will be in a customer's next order based on previous orders and trending items. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

### Part 1:
* Analyzed a large-scale online grocery shopping dataset to gain insights and develop a recommendation system for predicting customer's next order.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features and ensure data quality, applying feature engineering techniques to derive meanful features.

### Part 2:
* Utilized cross-validation to assess and compare the performance of different models, employing a gradient boosting classifier as the recommendation engine and performed hyper-parameter tuning to optimize its performance.
* Evaluated the recommendation system's performance through offline testing and user feedback, iterating on the system to enhance its effectiveness.
